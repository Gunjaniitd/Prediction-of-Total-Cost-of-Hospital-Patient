# Prediction-of-Total-Cost-of-Hospital-Patient

1. Implemented linear regression to predict the total cost incurred by a patient depending on the number of days of stay, illness, and other factors <br>
2. Implemented ridge regression to avoid overfitting. Used 10-fold cross-validation to determine the suitable value of regularization parameter <br>
3. Used polynomial features for feature creation and then, PCA and lasso regression for feature selection <br>
